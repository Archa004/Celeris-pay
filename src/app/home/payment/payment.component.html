   <h1>Payment API</h1>
   <p>Partner PSPs can use this API to send a payment transaction to be processed by CelerisPay’s payment gateway. This API functions as a client-side POST, either with form data (utilizing CelerisPay’s provided data wrappers) or a JSON object. The result is a redirect of the client browser to the appropriate bank URL. Upon a successful, failed, or cancelled transaction, the client will be redirected to the URL specified in the API.</p>
   <p>Currently, iframes are not supported for Net Banking payments due to bank requirements. CelerisPay can customize any intermediate pages to fit the look and feel of the partner or end-merchant. The Payment API supports the options of (1) using the Partner’s own payment page or (2) using CelerisPay’s hosted payment page.</p>
